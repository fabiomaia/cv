If you're already in conflicted state, and you want to just accept all of theirs:

<pre>
git checkout --theirs .
git add .
</pre>

If you want to do the opposite:

<pre>
git checkout --ours .
git add .
</pre>

This is pretty drastic, so make sure you really want to wipe everything out like this before doing it.
