<h1>Todo Lists</h1>

Most software engineers are used to leaving TODO comments in their source code, e.g.,

<ul>
  <li>
<pre>
process.env.NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED = '0' // TODO: this is cheating
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
<pre>
process.env.NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED = '0' // TODO: this is cheating
</pre>
  </li>
</ul>

What many don't realize is that if you follow this methodology of keeping

If you do this in a certain way you can even effectively version control many of your tasks. Then you can produce a list of todos quite easily:

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
grep -RInH "TODO" .
</pre>

<ul>
  <li><code>-R</code></li>
  <li><code>-I</code></li>
  <li><code>-n</code></li>
  <li><code>-H</code></li>
</ul>

For many cases (e.g., small to medium projects or solo projects) this is actually quite productive and really simple. It works anywhere <code>grep</code> is installed.

Feel free to wrap it in a utility script that you can extend as you go

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
DIR="$1"
STR="TODO"
grep -RInH "$STR" "$DIR"
</pre>
