If you start a shell and run

cat /proc/self/maps

If you strace it you can see

strace -y cat /proc/self/maps

OK it seems to be trying to resolve self to a particular pid and then reading /proc/<pid>/maps for you. Makes sense.

But wait, if you watch over it (the -d flag will highlight differences for you) a few iterations

watch -d strace -y cat /proc/self/maps

Why is this pid changing?
