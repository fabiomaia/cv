We have an arm64-linux binary that takes a single command line argument input that is a string and then computes a 32 byte HMAC on the input and prints it to stdout using base64 encoding

The task is to extract the secret used in the HMAC function

If you are unable to fully complete the task please explain what strategies you have used as part of your investigation.

The binary is named `main` and requires libcrypto from openssl in order to run since it uses the HMAC functions from libcrypto. We have included an arm64 alpine docker container that has the `main` binary at the location `/main` and has the dependencies already installed so it can be run.

This container should be able to be run on an x86 machine using the latest docker desktop distribution because it has multi-architecture support.

```
docker load < retest_docker_image.tar
docker run -it retest /bin/sh
/ # /main foo

```
```
