# üáµüáπ Portugal

Highlights of Portugal tailored for a multi-week roadtrip across the country, sorted from north to south. Most of these suggestions revolve around sightseeing, eating and beaching.

Consider that the coast side is more densely populated and arguably more interesting, so that is likely where you want to spend most of your time aside from maybe a couple of interior locations you may be curious about.

Naturally some of the best food to eat is fish and seafood. *Bacalhau* (codfish) dishes are something typical to try (*Bacalhau √† Br√°s* and *Bacalhau com Natas* are my favorites for example). *Pastel de nata* is obligatory.

Fun fact relating to big Berlin: on the beaches of Portugal they almost always sell *Bola de Berlim*, i.e. *Berliner Pfannkuchen*. If you see guys on the beach carrying a cooler and screaming like they're selling something, raise your hand if you want a snack. They'll bring it to you wherever you are on the sand.

## North

- Peneda-Ger√™s National Park [https://goo.gl/maps/nGa3rekmr4gwfUZS6](https://goo.gl/maps/nGa3rekmr4gwfUZS6)
    - beautiful nature park with lots of opportunities for hiking, trails, waterfalls, rivers, camping
    - Miradouro da Pedra Bela [https://goo.gl/maps/FBSyZRosF85SLED49](https://goo.gl/maps/FBSyZRosF85SLED49)

    - Camping place [https://goo.gl/maps/p8JrhBCGfT7PCPSg8](https://goo.gl/maps/p8JrhBCGfT7PCPSg8)
- Porto
    - Best sunset is on the bridge. Usually live music around.
    - Eat **francesinha** (quite heavy but delicious) and **bifana**. 
    - Do a cruise in the Douro river, from which you can see so many ‚Äúwine farms‚Äù afar
    - Do a tour of Porto's wineries and especially drink Porto wine.
- Aveiro (üè†¬†Fabio)
    - Best sunset is on the beach
        - either in one of the bars sitting directly on the beach
            - the best days are hot and sunny but with just a few clouds for optimal refractory effects
            - get a nice seat (be early), order lots of beer/sangria and snacks
            - usually in most of these bars you can also have something nice for dinner and enjoy the dusk
            - I highly recommend this particular place ...
        - or DIY sunset on the sand
    - Must eat Ovos Moles (calorie-bomb made from egg and sugar) before leaving
    - Must eat tripa (something like crepes but thicker, chocolate/nutella filling is the most popular)
- Coimbra
    - first university in Portugal, very classical city
    - end of may there is a parade essentially celebrating graduation
        - lots of people dressed up as ‚Äúharry potter‚Äù, a complex weird academic tradition that is still around today
        - **infinite free beer, just find the moving car parade, raise your hand and catch the beer cans**
- Nazare
    - biiiig fuckin waves
    - surfer/hippie hotspot
- Berlengas
    - cool little island close to the coast where you can hike, chill, swim, etc.
    - from Peniche you can take a ferry/boat to the island
    - you can sleep&eat in the castle/fortress on the island

## South

- Sintra
    - 
- Cascais
    - rich people hotspot, expensive real estate
- Lisbon
    - Cabo da Roca
        - west-most point in Europe
        - potential for an incredible sunset but it's hit or miss due to  extreme misty/foggy weather from the ocean
            - i was there in peak summer in August and it was super cold and foggy at the top. minutes after i left it's >30 degrees again. but the drive alone (in/back) is really beautiful
- Setubal
    - Portinho da Arrabida
    - Eat ‚Äúchoco frito‚Äù, i.e. fried squid. Not sure why but it is *particularly* famous in Setubal.

Costa Vicentina roadtrip

- Vila Nova de Milfontes
- Aljezur
- Sagres
    - drink lots of Sagres beer

Alentejo

- Alentejo is a general southern interior area. It's known for being super hot, dry, and absolutely nothing but hills and farms - which can be quite peaceful and relaxing. Mostly designed for chilling or walking/biking around.
- Incredible stargazing experiences due to the lack of artificial lights from civilization. Second week of August is magical with frequent meteor showers.
- I would definitely consider chilling there a few days, perhaps after the busy Lisbon. Just search "Alentejo" on Airbnb and see if you like the vibe.

Algarve

- Lagos
    - Cool bars and night life in the city center. Some techno/trance party hippies around the beaches in the summer time, look around Praia do Estudante at night (verified in 2021 pandemic times)
    - Praia do Camilo
    - Ponta da Piedade
        - Best sunset. It doesn't set on the water like the west-coast but incredible nonetheless due to the landscape. Bring drinks, snacks and nice music. A lot of people gather there and chill for 1-2 hours.
- Sugestao do  amigo erasmus
- Portimao
- Carvoeiro
- Faro
- East side of Algarve (closer to Spain) in general is highly underrated but very cool. Less crowded, bigger/wider beaches, peaceful.

## Azores

## Madeira
