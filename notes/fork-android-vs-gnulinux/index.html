<h1>fork in Android vs Linux</h1>

ANDROID STRACE APP
we should see the fork model, no fork+exec

As threads are in the same address space, a thread
context switch is inexpensive and fast. Also creation and destruction is quick. Unlike fork(), no
new copy of the parent process is made. In fact, creation of a thread uses the same system call as
fork() does, only with different flags:
clone(CLONE_VM | CLONE_FS | CLONE_FILES | CLONE_SIGHAND, 0);
The code above does basically the same as a normal process creation would do, with the exception
that the address space (VM), file system information (FS), open files (FILES) and signal handlers
along with blocked signals (SIGHAND) will be shared.

A normal fork goes like this:
clone(SIGCHLD, 0);
