<h1>Certificate Revocation Status via OCSP</h1>
<time datetime="2017-07-24">May 31, 2017</time>

<p>TLS is fundamentally based on trust. Operating systems will ship with a trusted set of certificates known as the root <strong>certificate authorities</strong> (CA for short) which are controlled by some companies. In turn, these are responsible for signing leaf certificates that are actually presented in TLS communications.</p>

- TLS clients can contact the CA's OCSP servers to verify the validity of the certificate of the destination server, which can leave a trace of a MITM certificate. **However our certificate is self-signed so there is no CA to contact so nothing happens in the first place.**
- Much like the previous status-checking method, [OCSP stapling](https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/ocsp-stapling-best-method-checking-certificate-validity/)
 is a process that also uses the online certificate status protocol. However, it’s a more advanced way of doing so. Instead of relying on the client to perform certificate revocation status checks, it places that responsibility on the web server instead.
    - In a stapling scenario, the certificate holder itself queries the OCSP server at regular intervals, obtaining a [signed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_signature) time-stamped OCSP response. When the site's visitors attempt to connect to the site, this response is included ("stapled") with the [TLS/SSL handshake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)
     via the Certificate Status Request extension response (note: the TLS client must explicitly include a Certificate Status Request extension in its ClientHello TLS/SSL handshake message)

<p>But how would you actually validate certificates appropriately? There are essentially two steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chain of trust validation</li>
<li>Certification status validation</li>
</ul>

Let's see how this could be done on a Python server leveraging a few libraries. For simplicity I'll inline the imports along with the code snippets.

Essentially we want to implement a high level function: 

<pre>
def validate(cert: bytes):
    if not verify_chain_of_trust(cert):
        raise Exception('Invalid certificate')
    if not verify_ocsp(cert):
        raise Exception('Revoked certificate')
</pre>

Let's define some helper getter functions that are needed every step of the way: issuer, subject, and OCSP endpoint of a certificate.

<pre>
def get_cert_issuer(cert):
    obj = x509.load_der_x509_certificate(cert, default_backend())
    return obj.issuer.get_attributes_for_oid(NameOID.COMMON_NAME)[0].value

def get_cert_subject(cert):
    obj = x509.load_der_x509_certificate(cert, default_backend())
    return obj.subject.get_attributes_for_oid(NameOID.COMMON_NAME)[0].value

def get_cert_ocsp(cert):
    obj = x509.load_der_x509_certificate(cert, default_backend())

    try:
        url = obj.extensions.get_extension_for_oid(ExtensionOID.AUTHORITY_INFORMATION_ACCESS).value[0].access_location.value
        url = url.replace('https', 'http')
    except:
        # Hardcode the OCSP URL for 'Cartão de Cidadão 001' the first (and only) certificate
        # signed by ECRaizEstado which did not specify OCSP because it was only introduced in 2014
        # as announced at https://www.ecce.gov.pt/noticias/
        url = 'http://ocsp.ecee.gov.pt' if get_cert_subject(cert) == 'Cartão de Cidadão 001' else None

    return url
</pre>

Then we load the certificates

<pre>
def load_certs():
    certs = {}
    with open('./cc_certs/PT.pem', 'rb') as f:
        for _, _, pem_bytes in pem.unarmor(f.read(), multiple=True):
            certs[get_cert_subject(pem_bytes)] = {
                'bytes': pem_bytes,
                'subject': get_cert_subject(pem_bytes),
                'issuer': get_cert_issuer(pem_bytes),
                'ocsp': get_cert_ocsp(pem_bytes)
            }
    return certs
</pre>

First, the verify_chain_of_trust method will check if the 
 
<pre>
def verify_chain_of_trust(cert_pem):
    certificate = OpenSSL.crypto.load_certificate(OpenSSL.crypto.FILETYPE_PEM, cert_pem)
    intermediates = [cert['bytes'] for cert in load_certs().values()]

    # Create and fill a X509Sore with trusted certs
    store = OpenSSL.crypto.X509Store()
    for intermediate in intermediates:
        i = OpenSSL.crypto.load_certificate(crypto.FILETYPE_ASN1, intermediate)
        store.add_cert(i)

    # Create a X590StoreContext with the cert and trusted certs
    # and verify the chain of trust
    store_ctx = OpenSSL.crypto.X509StoreContext(store, certificate)
    # Returns None if certificate can be validated
    result = store_ctx.verify_certificate()

    if result is None:
        return True
    else:
        return False
 </pre>

Secondly the the verify_ocsp will make a request to the OCSP endpoint to check the revocation status of the certificate

<pre>
def verify_ocsp(cert):
    cert_store = load_certs()
    subject_cert = asymmetric.load_certificate(cert)
    subject_bytes = pem.unarmor(cert)[2]

    # Verify each pair-wise subject-issuer relationship against respective OCSP endpoint
    while True:
        subject_name = get_cert_subject(subject_bytes)
        subject_ocsp = get_cert_ocsp(subject_bytes)

        issuer_name = get_cert_issuer(subject_bytes)
        issuer_bytes = cert_store[issuer_name]['bytes']

        issuer_cert = keys.parse_certificate(issuer_bytes)
        ocsp_request = OCSPRequestBuilder(subject_cert, issuer_cert).build().dump()

        # Stop if we are at a self-signed certificate
        if subject_name == issuer_name:
            break

        if subject_ocsp:
            response = requests.post(subject_ocsp, headers={'Content-Type': 'application/ocsp-request'}, data=ocsp_request)
            ocsp_response = OCSPResponse.load(response.content)

            response_status = ocsp_response['response_status']
            cert_status = ocsp_response.basic_ocsp_response['tbs_response_data']['responses'][0]['cert_status'].name

            # Hard-fail if the OCSP endpoint did not respond 200 OK (e.g. server is down, internal server error, malicious redirect, etc)
            if not response.status_code == 200:
                return False

            # Fail if the OCSP responseStatus isn't successful
            if not response_status == OCSPResponseStatus(0):
                return False

            # Fail if the certificate status isn't 'good'
            if not cert_status == 'good':
                return False
        else:
            # Fail if a OCSP endpoint could not be found reliably
            return False

        # Next iteration
        subject_bytes = issuer_bytes
        subject_cert = asymmetric.load_certificate(subject_bytes)

    # At this point all certificates have been successfully verified
    return True
</pre>
