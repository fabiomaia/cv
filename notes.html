Taking notes
Note-taking applications have too many features. I just want to write stuff down quickly. Like a thought dump, a stream of random strings.

For me this suffices

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
vim stream.txt
</pre>

Then you can get creative and do things like, e.g.,

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
read _text
_date=$(date +'%Y-%m-%d')
echo -e "\n$_date: $_text" >> ~/Dropbox/notes/stream.txt
</pre>
