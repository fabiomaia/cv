				<li>From <time datetime="2017-05">May 2017</time> to <time datetime="2017-08">August 2017</time> I was a student researcher in Aveiro at CIDMA's Geometrix group where I developed interactive web applications for teaching mathematics to children with ASD.</li>
				<li>From <time datetime="2017-09">September 2017</time> to <time datetime="2018-09">September 2018</time> I was a student researcher in Aveiro at IEETA's Bioinformatics group where I explored software for biomedical text processing with the goal of improving performance in chemical entity mention recognition.</li>
				<li>Since <time datetime="2020-02">February 2020</time> I am a software engineer in Berlin at <a href="https://bliq.ai">Bliq</a> where I</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Developed minimal AOSP distribution for efficiently driving headless automation tests of Android applications, running on top of a custom Linux kernel for Arm64 CPUs.</li>
					<li>Reverse engineered 3rd party Android applications (notably embedded C/C++ libraries) and Google Play Services with state-of-the-art security protection against emulation and debugging.</li>
					<li>Developed software for hooking Android processes based on Frida. Developed a traffic sniffing and manipulation engine based on iptables and proxy servers.</li>
					<li>Became an early influential engineer at a pivot point in the company, and helped raise late seed funding by developing the product from MVP to production at 1000 concurrent users. After a successful Series A funding round, I grew and led a team of engineers responsible for a virtualization stack that scaled up to 10000 concurrent users in production.</li>
